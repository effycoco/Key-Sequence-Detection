# Key Sequence Detection (KONAMI CODE)

A project from [JavaScript 30 - 12](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)

Everytime you press 'sunshine' in keyboard, a new unicorn will apprear in the window.

**Key sequence detection** means when somebody inputs a certain sequence of keys into your window or into a inputter, then something needs to happen. What this is used most for online is the Konami code, which is you can type in up, up, down, down, left, left, right, left, right, B, A, enter, it will trigger unlimited lives in Mario or something like that.

For example, [BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com) has a Konami code. If you go to the website and press up, up, down, down, left, right, left, right, B, A, enter, it will show confetti effects in the background.
